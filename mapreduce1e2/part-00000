Peopling of the Americas - Wikipedia	"maps depicting each phase of the three-step early human migrations for the peopling of the americas. (a) gradual population expansion of the amerind ancestors from their central east asian gene pool (blue arrow). (b) proto-amerind occupation of beringia with little to no population growth for ≈20,000 years. (c) rapid colonization of the new world by a founder group migrating southward through the ice-free, inland corridor between the eastern laurentide and western cordilleran ice sheets (green arrow) and/or along the pacific coast (red arrow). in (b), the exposed seafloor is shown at its greatest extent during the last glacial maximum at ≈20–18,000 years ago [25]. in (a) and (c), the exposed seafloor is depicted at ≈40,000 years ago and ≈16,0000 years ago, when prehistoric sea levels were comparable. a scaled-down version of beringia today (60% reduction of a–c) is presented in the lower left corner. this smaller map highlights the bering strait that has geographically separated the new world from asia since ≈11–10,000 years ago."
Peopling of the Americas - Wikipedia	schematic illustration of maternal geneflow in and out of beringia.colours of the arrows correspond to approximate timing of the events and are decoded in the coloured time-bar. the initial peopling of berinigia (depicted in light yellow) was followed by a standstill after which the ancestors of indigenous americans spread swiftly all over the new world, while some of the beringian maternal lineages–c1a-spread westwards. more recent (shown in green) genetic exchange is manifested by back-migration of a2a into siberia and the spread of d2a into north-eastern america that post-dated the initial peopling of the new world.

Spanish conquest of Guatemala - Wikipedia	pedro de alvarado entered guatemala from the west along the southern pacific plain in 1524, before swinging northwards and fighting a number of battles to enter the highlands. he then executed a broad loop around the north side of the highland lake atitlán, fighting further battles along the way, before descending southwards once more into the pacific lowlands. two more battles were fought as his forces headed east into what is now el salvador. in 1525 hernán cortés entered northern guatemala from the north, crossed to lake petén itzá and continued roughly southeast to lake izabal before turning east to the gulf of honduras.
